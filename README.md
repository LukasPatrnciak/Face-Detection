# Face-Detection
The goal of this assignment is to implement a program in the selected programming language that can find faces in an image. As part of this assignment, we have a database of photographs and their corresponding YOLO annotations. The task is to process these photographs (and YOLO annotations) so that you can draw annotations (you need to make a collage of 6 photographs with annotations) and also test the selected image preprocessing method. 

The next step will consist in recognizing faces in these images by two trained detectors (Haar Cascade and MediaPipe), while calculating Precision, Recall and F1 scores before IoU > 0.7. At the end of the chapter, the results will be analyzed. The next step will consist in training, respectively training of the own detector, while the architecture of the given detector will be described and the accuracy metrics will also be calculated,

Let us recall the F1 score before IoU > 0.7, including the plotting of the confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN).
The last chapter will be devoted to the comparison of the two methods and their success - comparing the result to find out the form in the case of trained detectors and trained own detector.
